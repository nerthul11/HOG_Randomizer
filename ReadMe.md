# Hall of Gods Randomizer

A Randomizer add-on for Hall of Gods statues.

This will randomize four locations for each HoG Boss:
- Unlock --> An item is granted when defeating a boss in the overworld.
- Attuned --> An item is granted when defeating the Attuned version.
- Ascended --> An item is granted when defeating the Ascended version.
- Radiant --> An item is granted when defeating the Radiant version.

Likewise, there will be new items affecting these locations:
- Unlock --> Instead of unlocking when a boss is defeated, the "X Unlock" item will be required.
- Bronze mark --> Instead of being obtained when defeating an attuned boss, the "X Bronze" item will be required.
- Silver mark --> Instead of being obtained when defeating an ascended boss, the "X Silver" item will be required.
- Gold mark --> Instead of being obtained when defeating a radiant boss, the "X Gold" item will be required.

These are progressive (meaning that you first unlock a boss, then obtain each mark in Bronze/Silver/Gold order), and the requirements for the Void Idol will be defined by these locations instead of requiring the actual defeat of each boss.

All this should add a whopping total of 176 new items and locations to the Randomization pool!

Settings:
- Enabled --> Boolean to define if the connection should be active or not.
- Limit --> Options: Attuned, Ascended, Radiant. Defines which locations should be randomized and contain items and which should remain vanilla.
- Randomize access --> Defines if the "Unlock" feature is randomized or vanilla.
