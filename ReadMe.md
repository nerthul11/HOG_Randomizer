# Hall of Gods Randomizer

A Randomizer add-on for Hall of Gods statues.

This will randomize four locations for each HoG Boss:
- Unlock --> An item is granted when defeating a boss in the overworld.
- Attuned --> An item is granted when defeating the Attuned version.
- Ascended --> An item is granted when defeating the Ascended version.
- Radiant --> An item is granted when defeating the Radiant version.

Settings:
- Enabled --> Boolean to define if the connection should be active or not.
- Limit --> Options: Attuned, Ascended, Radiant. Defines which locations should be randomized and contain items and which should remain vanilla.
- Randomize access --> Defines if the "Unlock" feature is randomized or vanilla.
